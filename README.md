# Miners-haven-New-Heights
This is the Miner's Haven open source BUT with working Hydraulics And Platforms
I recomend if you wanna use this START A NEW MODDED HAVEN, if not and you import the items from your old modded haven the game will break!

Latest(New/Way Less Buggy): MinersHavenNewHeightsWorkingV4.rbxl
Legacy (Old/Buggy): MinersHavenNewHeightsWorkingV2.rbxl

MinersHavenNewHeightsWorkingV4.rbxl has got support for you to just copy and paste your current modded haven games (if you already have one) to just replace the items folder in this open source with your current (if you have one) modded haven items!

You can also start a new modded haven with this!
