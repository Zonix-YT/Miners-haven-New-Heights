# Miners-haven-New-Heights
This is the Miner's Haven open source BUT with working Hydraulics And Platforms
I recomend if you wanna use this START A NEW MODDED HAVEN, if not and you import the items from your old modded haven the game will break!

If you are using MinersHavenNewHeightsWorkingV3.rbxl and you wanna put your current Modded haven items in feel free! Just put a Int Value into the Mega Platform and Large/Standard Platform and call it "Shards" and set there ItemType Value to 7!
