For reborn fusions:
ItemType = 6
Tier = 31
New Folder in the item called "FusionCost"
2 intValues in the "FusionCost" folder and name them the 2 reborn item id's fusion (you can do 3 reborns into one fusion or more!)
then make the value how ever many of that reborn you want for the fusion!
done!
It is now in craftsman and can be crafted!

I am bad at explaining, sorry.
Regardless, hope this helped. - Zonix
