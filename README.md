# Miners-haven-New-Heights
This is the Miner's Haven open source BUT with working Hydraulics And Platforms
I recomend if you wanna use this START A NEW MODDED HAVEN, if not and you import the items from your old modded haven the game will break!
Also the first custom Item's ItemId is 578 since the hydraulic standard platform is added <--- Not if your using the MinersHavenNewHeightsWorkingV2.rbxl file
