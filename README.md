Legacy (Old/Buggy): MinersHavenNewHeightsWorkingV2.rbxl

You can also start a new modded haven with this!

You do have to make item icons for the platforms and hydraulics!

V8 and newer allows you to add sacrifices without coding and fusions and evos are in the craftsman and are not in rebirths

V8.1 is the final version and allows you to add NPC's without scripting!
